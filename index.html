            Lets build the future of education together. Advances in technology
            now allow students to study entirely online while still socializing
            with classmates, watching lectures and participating in
            subject-specific discussions.

          Poverty is the state of having few material possessions or little
          income. Poverty can have diverse social, economic, and political
          causes and effects. When evaluating poverty in statistics or economics
          there are two main measures: absolute poverty compares income against
          the amount needed to meet basic personal needs, such as food,
          clothing, and shelter; relative poverty measures when a person cannot
          meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the
          same time and place. The definition of relative poverty varies from
          one country to another, or from one society to another
